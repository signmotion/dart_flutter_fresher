## üî• Motivation

The road to üñ§ is paved with good intentions.

I just wanted to show in the `README`s of my packages how to contribute to open-source, because I remember how hard it was to start doing that for me. The problem was that when the thought came to my mind, I already had dozens packages in pub.dev... Well, I did it manually that time.

After seeing the shields in other packages (thanks for that, guys and gals) and wanting to add them to my packages too... And this time I did it by hand.

One sunny afternoon I read on Reddit that people are looking for projects to help the open-source community, and I read in the comments about [CodeTriangle](https://codetriage.com) - Free community tools for contributing... And that time I did it by hand for some of my packages.

When I came across resources like [The ultimate Flutter resources](https://github.com/yassine-bennkhay/Ultimate-Flutter-Resources) and [Learn Dart in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/dart), I wanted to add them too because both Dart and Flutter are really üåü awesome.

More packages were added, and more time was spent on updating them. Should I go on?

Honestly, I didn't want to create this package because I realized the complexity and I [heard](https://reddit.com/r/dartlang/comments/1bzltni/a_build_system_for_dozens_of_flutter_dart_projects): "Melos / Cider / Publish Tools / Sidekick will solve your problems with Dart / Flutter package maintenance". I spent ~2 weeks researching the available tools and I've tabulated my research below.

## üìä Research

The purpose of the project {{project_title}} is to _"keep packages up to date"_, so I wrote out features for that purpose and for those purposes that seemed to be needed in the future.

- [Cider](https://pub.dev/packages/cider)
- [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev)
- [PublishTools](https://pub.dev/packages/publish_tools)
- [Sidekick](https://github.com/phntmxyz/sidekick)

I guess now you will be able to choose the right tool for your needs much faster.

## üåü Features

The **{{project_title}}** has significant differences from researched products:

1. **Invisible to maintained projects.**
   You can update your awesome projects with **{{project_title}}** and then switch to another tool(s) or even drop the tools altogether and not even notice it: **{{project_title}}** doesn't make a single change to the configuration of your projects. So if you decide to stop using **{{project_title}}**, you could still manage your projects. But you lose the automation and all the magic ü™ÑÔ∏è

2. **Freedom to choose the structure and variables for your projects**.
   Below I'll show you what I chose, but my solution is not the only possible one.

It can do the following:

1. Updates any folders and files from **3 tiers** - root, sdk and project - inheriting changes.

2. Upgrades `pubspec.yaml` files with **resolvable** versions.

3. Displays the git logs of the supported projects after the first 2 steps.

4. Keeps up to date (maintains) **multiple** projects with **multiple** repositories (_multirepos_).

That's all I needed. I have upgraded all [my packages](https://pub.dev/publishers/syrokomskyi.com/packages) and am enjoying working with this functionality.

The **{{project_title}}** got 2 more unplanned uses:

1. It can be used for keep **any** your libraries up to date: GitHub, npm, PyPi, Maven, NuGet, RubyGems, etc.

2. You can use **{{project_title}}** to build **any** template with **any** complex folder-file-content structure.

And it has limitation:

- **All** maintained projects must be placed in the same folder as `{{project_id}}`.

## üöÄ Usage

Please, read the **Features** above before reading **Usage**.

Let's take a look at this folder structure:

![Root folders of any Dart project](images/screenshots/root_dart_any_base.png)

I am using VS Code, so forgive me these screenshots if you are using a different IDE.

Above we have seen the root structure of any Dart project, haven't we?

So in our **base**, we see the following folders:

![Root folders for base](images/screenshots/root_base.png)

Which includes:

| Folders                                |                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+`<br/>_files & folders to be copied_ | ![Files for add from root base](images/screenshots/files_for_add_from_root_base.png)               |
| `dart`<br/>_projects on Dart_          | ![Files for add from Dart SDK base](images/screenshots/files_for_add_from_dart_sdk_base.png)       |
| `flutter`<br/>_projects on Flutter_    | ![Files for add from Flutter SDK base](images/screenshots/files_for_add_from_flutter_sdk_base.png) |

This is a project structure, SDKs, and our (ok, mine) maintaned projects.

All files in the folder `+` will be copied to each maintaned project.

Take a look inside `id_gen` folder:

| Folder                     |                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id_gen`<br/>_the project_ | ![Files for add from id_gen Dart SDK base](images/screenshots/files_for_add_from_id_gen_dart_sdk_base.png) |

As you see, we keep the same file structure as for any Dart project with additional folder `+README.md` (yes, it's a folder) and `+.yaml` file.

Take a look at the file `id_gen/+/+.yaml` (a **project** tier):

```yaml
variables:
  project_id: id_gen
  project_title: IdGen
  project_title_for_readme: ID Generators
```

... the file `dart/+/+.yaml` (an **SDK** tier):

```yaml
variables:
  workflow_file_name: dart-ci.yml
```

... the file `./+/+.yaml` (a **root** tier):

```yaml
file_conflict_resolutions:
  - name: CHANGELOG.md
    resolution: doNotOverwrite

variables:
  current_year: 2025

  owner_full_name: Andrii Syrokomskyi
  owner_id: signmotion
  owner_website: https://syrokomskyi.com

  publisher_id: syrokomskyi.com
```

Pay attention to `variables`: their values we can use in any other values. How? Just look at file `id_gen/+README.md/description.md`:

```md
The standardized, easy-to-use, and [well-tested](https://github.com/{owner_id}/{project_id}/tree/master/test) set for generating IDs.
```

The `{owner_id}/{project_id}` part will be replaced by `{{owner_id}}/{{project_id}}`, which was defined above in several `+.yaml` files.

We can even redefine `owner_website` as:

```yaml
  ...
  owner_website: https://{publisher_id}
  ...
```

and the final value will be `https://{{publisher_id}}`. Easy, isn't it?

Just replace it with your own _publisher-website-description_ and get your basic structure for your packages!

- You can add **any** names you want and use them in **any** files.
- **Any** depth of nesting will be addressed to the final content.
- The values of all variables and files with the same name will be replaced by those defined at a deeper tier.

For example, you can define the contents of `./+/README.md` for all your projects as follows:

![README file from root base](images/screenshots/readme_md_from_root_base.png)

Notice: The filename is the name of the variable.

Running **{{project_title}}** will produce [this result](https://github.com/signmotion/id_gen/blob/master/README.md).

The **base** (template, configuration) of your projects is defined as separate project.

I've done this for my packages, I'm using this for the new projects, and I'm [sharing this solution](https://github.com/signmotion/dart_flutter_fresher) with you. Welcome back from boring hell!

### File Conflict Resolutions

What is `file_conflict_resolutions` in `+.yaml` file?

The **{{project_title}}** is _invisible_ for all maintananted packages. In the best [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).
Therefore, it must know how to resolve conflicts for files. For example, with a declaration like this:

```yaml
file_conflict_resolutions:
  - name: CHANGELOG.md
    resolution: doNotOverwrite
```

the `CHANGELOG.md` file is not replaced by the new version if it is already present in the project. Thus, using **{{project_title}}** for your wonderful projects is safe.

| Resolutions      |                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `doNotOverwrite` | A file will be skipped when present and added otherwise. |
| `overwrite`      | A file will be overwrite.                                |

The default is `overwrite`.

### Summary

We have 3 tiers:

1. **Root**.
2. **SDK**.
3. **Project**.

In each tier, we declare our files, variables, and their values.

Deeper tier definitions replace variables and files with the same name.

The folder named `+` contains files and folders that will be added to maintained projects.

The folder prefixed with `+` contains variables named the same as the files whose contents are their values.

The file named `+.yaml` contains some (or many) variables with values.

The value is templated with [mustache syntactic](https://mustache.github.io) text.
We can utilize **any** variables defined in `+.yaml` files and `+` folders.

In light of this, we (you) can construct a hierarchy of **any** complexity.

We create an external folder (call it the "base project") and put this folder in the **same** folder where all our packages are located. Then we run in CLI from the "base project"

```sh
cls | dart ../fresher/bin/fresher.dart .
```

to upgrade all projects or

```sh
cls | dart ../fresher/bin/fresher.dart --projects id_gen,title_widget .
```

to upgrade only the `id_gen` and `title_widget` projects. Of course, replace with your good project names.

I'm sharing [my "base project"](https://github.com/signmotion/dart_flutter_fresher). Just clone it and create your own **base** for your packages.
